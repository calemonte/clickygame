# Kitty Klicker

"Kitty Klicker" is a simple memory game built with React (and cute kittens). To play, click on any image to get started, but make sure you remember which one it was -- clicking on the same image twice will knock your score down to 0!

Deployed application: https://calemonte.github.io/clickygame/

## Develop

Clone the repository and then `npm install` the dependencies.

```
git clone git@github.com:calemonte/clickygame.git
cd /clickygame
npm install
```

This project was built using React, so the dependencies are large. To run the application in a development environment, enter `npm start`.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- HTML/CSS

## Notes

This was my first application using React! Lots more to learn, but it was a fun experience. Future development goals include implementing CSS grid so as to reduce reliance on media queries.

## Contribute

This was built by Kenny Whitebloom (https://github.com/calemonte) as part of a coding class, but if you are interested in contributing, feel free to open a pull request from a new branch.
